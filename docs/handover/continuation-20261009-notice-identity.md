# Heavy checkpoint — 9 October 2026, 23:22 Europe/Bucharest

## Follow-up at 23:27 RO: request to leave maintenance

The owner then asked whether the app could be put back live. Read-only inspection confirmed no processor is currently running, but the 9 October run failed at `identity-quality` after normalization; statistics/reconciliation stages did not run. The last ready publication is checkpoint19 from7October (ready06:17UTC). `executeMonitoringStages` commits stages separately; serving the current database would mix newer core records with older derived statistics and an unresolved publication-deduplication check. No maintenance toggle, restore, collector restart or data repair was performed in response. Reopening does not require finishing historical collection, but does require a verified consistent dataset: repair/validate publication, or plan and validate restoration/serving of the last good dataset while preserving newer archives and application data. Scheduled05:00processing remains enabled.

## Start here: owner decision and current blocker

**Collection is STOPPED. Leave it stopped until the owner resumes work tomorrow.** The owner asked whether they should restart it, was advised not to, and explicitly said: “ok, we will do that tomorrow”. The latest request is documentation/checkpointing before clearing the session, not authorization to restart tonight.

Earlier authorization remains the scope of the unfinished work: fix notice identity, recover known gaps, then reconcile historical inventories with correct identities. The identity fix is deployed; the historical scan has started but is now blocked by a real pagination discrepancy. Do not conflate that with the separate nightly publication failure.

At this checkpoint only read-only production inspection and local documentation were performed. **No new SEAP requests, repair, unblock, restart, deployment, scheduler change or rate change during checkpointing.**

The chronological implementation report has earlier statements saying “running” or “temporarily paused for migration”. Those are historical observations. This checkpoint and its latest live evidence supersede them.

### Live state, checked at 23:20–23:22 RO / 20:20–20:22 UTC

| Item | Verified state |
|---|---|
| Server checkout | `a39eccac5a762dabd89bb56f45db3e952e246f1f` |
| Collection control | revision **103**, `paused=false`, `maintenance=true`, `collection_during_maintenance=true` |
| Actual stop | `blocked_reason = Sarcina 542533: SEAP a repetat înregistrări între pagini.` |
| Batch | `recovery-2026-09-25`, `end_day=2026-10-08`, `follow_latest=true`, stored status `collecting` |
| Meaning of stored status | Neither `paused=false` nor batch `collecting` means requests are running; the global integrity block prevents admission |
| Migrations | **65**, through `0064_notice_namespace_identity.sql` |
| Proxy settings | **94 enabled / 100 configured**, **200 starts/min ceiling**, **10 concurrent**, **35–45 seconds/IP** |
| Historical notice inventory | **1,355 complete pages**, **1 failed**, **4,957 pending**, no running pages |
| Other outstanding work | **7 failed detail tasks**, **1 pending detail task** |
| Last source request start | **2026-10-09 20:00:23.600399 UTC** / **23:00:23 RO** |
| Nightly scheduler | Still enabled, **05:00 RO**, risk weekday **0 = Sunday**; not disabled by this session |
| Last processing | 9 October `full`, failed at `identity-quality`, 05:00:02–05:19:16 RO |

**Inspect again tomorrow.** Scheduled processing/daily batch extension may run overnight and change core rows, raw boundaries, controls or retry state. Do not assume the database remains frozen merely because collection is blocked. No successful publication or site reopening was performed in this repair.

## Immediate pagination incident: exact evidence to resume from

- Stream: **awards**, historical list-only inventory.
- Publication day: **2024-11-28**.
- Partition: `awards:list::2024-11-28:2024-11-28:inventory`.
- Page0 task **537029**, complete; started20:00:14.593774UTC, finished20:00:20.588199UTC.
- Page1 task **542533**, failed; started20:00:21.070816UTC, finished20:00:24.368254UTC.
- Request **421931**: **HTTP200**, transport outcome **success**, but application pagination validation failed. Do not look only for failed HTTP requests in `/admin/jurnal`.
- Endpoint: `POST /api-pub/NoticeCommon/GetCANoticeList/`.
- Parameters:

```json
{
  "pageSize": 100,
  "pageIndex": 1,
  "sysNoticeTypeIds": [3, 13, 18, 16, 8, 20],
  "startPublicationDate": "2024-11-28",
  "endPublicationDate": "2024-11-28",
  "contractingAuthorityId": null
}
```

Both responses declare **total180**. Page0 has100IDs; page1 has80IDs, all distinct within page1. **ID100512354 appears on both pages. Combined unique population is179, not180.** Consequently this cannot be fixed by simply accepting overlaps or using `Set` and marking the day complete. One advertised unique record is still unaccounted for.

- Response hash: `18b1d3e37c064bf8e91819a5d0e865300c941c5504586932277063328beaa43a`.
- Complete captured response is in request421931 diagnostics: `diagnostics.taskFailure.response` and/or `diagnostics.response.body`. The runner preserved it after the validation exception.
- [Safe extracted evidence](checkpoints/20261009-notice-identity/pagination-summary.json) is public metadata only.
- Local fuller evidence: `.local/notice-identity-20261009/checkpoint/blocked-pagination.json` (ignored, not needed to recover from production).
- The failed page did **not** reach archive/checkpoint commit. Successful earlier pages and their evidence remain; do not delete or overwrite them.

### Tomorrow's repair approach, not yet executed

1. Read this checkpoint and recheck live control, tasks, requests and overnight processing before changing anything.
2. Retrieve both existing page payloads, compare complete repeated rows, notice numbers and exact identities, not numeric IDs alone. Inspect the client request builder and endpoint ordering. Unstable ordering/overlap is a hypothesis, not established root cause.
3. If new source probes are needed, use the installed production client/shared gate and count them. Do not bypass rate limits with direct `curl` to SEAP. The global block must not be casually cleared merely to probe; design a guarded, bounded recovery operation that preserves evidence and settings.
4. Determine how to obtain all180distinct, identity-verified records: a source-supported stable order, a fresh isolated partition attempt, or a verified disjoint filter partition may be possibilities. Verify actual API support; do not invent sort/filter options. Existing contract-page overlap handling is useful precedent, **not** proof the same behavior is correct for notice lists.
5. Add meaningful regression fixtures using the observed100+80rows/one overlap/179unique failure. Never silently accept179of180; preserve conflicts and exact final reconciliation.
6. Test locally on an isolated `seap_test_*` database; deploy the correction if code changes are necessary. Preserve old task results and request attempts. A changed paging strategy needs an explicit new attempt/partition or audited reset of the affected partition, not a fake successful task.
7. Resume collection only after the affected partition is verified and the exact blocker can safely be removed under current-state guards. Do not reset unrelated operator controls or source errors.
8. Verify new source requests, resumed inventory progress, zero unexpected global blocks, and update this handover. Only certify the layers actually reconciled.

Potential secondary issue to inspect: several detail tasks are `failed` while their retry rows still say `pending` with timeout count2. This was observed during checkpointing, not diagnosed or repaired. Do not call all these retries “exhausted” or reset them blindly.

## What initiated the work

Owner asked whether **everything** was collected throughout the years after the current queue exhausted. The [9 October completeness audit](../audits/20261009-collection-completeness/README.md) found concrete omissions and an identity collision, not a certificate of complete history. Its wording “no repair applied” is the original audit state, superseded by the subsequent implementation.

Audit baseline:

- Scope2018–2026 through8October2026; no pre2018/legacy-SEAP completeness claim.
- **37 bounded additional SEAP calls, allHTTP200**:18annual notice first pages,9DA first pages,8historical contract inventories,2identity roots. They used production's shared gate. Saved probes from8October were reused without repeating source calls.
- Participation public ID **100004524** is both **CN1002119** (internal100038419, CN route) and **SCN1002813** (RFQ route; root internal100019534). Production's numeric-only unique key retained only the SCN row.
- First100participation notices per year2018–2025: **221/800** displaced/missing correct notice numbers. Per-year counts19,8,17,39,38,23,15,62. This is a first-page sample, not a representative loss estimate.
- Current raw participation lists:18,167rows;37wrong normalized identities and51notyetnormalized. Numeric ID presence hid the37wrong records.
- Historical award sample800records had no identity mismatch. That does not prove all award namespaces globally collision-free.
- **115award notices for21April2022** absent from core, their raw lists and linked contract inventories, independently confirmed from two saved source pages.
- Current2026recovery:281days of each notice family reconciled;18,167participation notices;33,742award notices; all33,742award contract inventories reconciled (248,382contract-notice memberships,2,772legitimately empty). **76detail tasks** still failed:66type18roots,2type20roots,2type3eForms,6type3root transport failures.
- CurrentDArecovery:38,425known authorities;192,110closed leaves;630,504records forJuly1–October8. HistoricalDA~21.3millioncore rows but no exhaustive historical authority/window manifest.
- Historical logging had2,922tender days and2,921award days completed/reconciled; the missing award day is21April2022. Many runs explicitly deferred v2forms, so completed list logs did not certify forms.
- Production historical raw responses generally weren't retained: existing SEAP raw lists begin26September2026, detail responses8October. Never rebuild all normalized historical data from this incomplete raw archive.
- Annual source totals are capped (`3000/searchTooLong` for notices, `2000/searchTooLong` forDA); do not use them as true denominators.
- Nine annualDAfirst-page samples:900IDs all present. Eight sampled awards with no contracts returned empty source inventories. Neither sample proves exhaustive coverage.
- PDF backfill was not authorized or performed. On-demand authenticated downloads remain separate. DA item-level detail and TEDcatch-up are also separate; storedTEDcoverage ended30June2026 at audit time.

## Identity fix: exact implementation

Commit **e948a9c**, deployed successfully, migration **0064**:

| Source types | Namespace |
|---|---|
|2|`cn`|
|6|`dc`|
|7|`pc`|
|12,17,19|`rfq` (shared RFQInvitation endpoint)|

- `packages/scraper-clients/src/elicitatie/notice-identity.ts`: `participationNamespace`, `participationKey`, `noticeArchiveKey`; rejects unsupported/invalid identities. Awards retain `award:<publicId>`; comparing their notice number adds a conflict check rather than assuming sample proof.
- `packages/db/src/schema/core.ts`: generated stored NOTNULL `core.notices.notice_namespace`; nullable `internal_notice_id`; unique `(notice_namespace,c_notice_id)` replaces global numeric unique. Nonunique public-ID index supports lookups. Existing core surrogate IDs preserved.
- `core.notice_award_sources`: namespace included in primary key and explicit association joins. Existing one documented source bridge was verified by its exact notice number before backfill.
- Migration refuses unknown types, active processing or running tender tasks; preserves existing task IDs/status/results/retry associations. Tender detail keys/partitions gain namespace. No manual migration history changes, raw history rewrite, watermark reset or automatic full normalization.
- `apps/ingestion/src/normalize/parsers.ts`: upsert on scoped key; persist internal ID; reject different known notice number or internal ID at the same scoped key; sparse payloads cannot erase existing identity. Correct source title/procedure handling is covered by regression tests.
- `apps/ingestion/src/collection/plan.ts`: participation pages reconcile scoped identities, including across page boundaries. Same numericCN/SCN can coexist; types12/17sharingRFQ cannot masquerade as distinct notices. Legacy continuation pages lacking scoped identity arrays fail closed.
- List/detail archives use `tender:cn:<id>`, `tender:rfq:<id>`, etc. Existing archives remain readable. State-rescan handles both legacy and scoped keys by actual payload identity.
- Admin detail aggregation and document association join are scoped. Document keys already contained type; document source lookup still requires correct authority and supported type17.
- `apps/ingestion/src/scripts/replay-notice-identities.ts`: explicit repairCLI, `--apply` required for mutation, paused+maintenance+inactiveprocessing guard, dedicated advisory lock, fixedrawboundary, batches200in **numeric raw-ID order**, normal parser transactions. No source calls/marts/watermark resets. Execute under host deploy/processing flock too.

## Backups, rehearsal and production repair

Before production migration, all193,011notice identity projections were rehearsed on isolated `seap_test_notice_rehearsal_20261009`. This was a schema/identity projection rehearsal, **not** a full production clone or publication validation.

Production backup `/srv/seap/backups/notice-identity-20261009/`:

- `notices-before.dump` (~8.7MB): data for notices and notice-award source associations.
- `tender-task-keys-before.csv` (~9.7MB): IDs and old keys/partitions.
- `schema-before.sql`.
- `SHA256SUMS`; all three checks passed.
- Later `known-tender-recovery.json`, `import-reviewed-lists.mjs`, `replay.log` saved here too.

Guarded `pause.sql` moved control101→102 with maintenance preserved. Migration installed normally;65migration records, no loss of193,011existing notice rows.

The **221saved source records** have bundleSHA256:

```text
c47adb62159b78a8b65a4469aa7c3b8490f5b4048607e783c41bc19c5eb09752
```

`import-reviewed-lists.mjs` verifies this hash,221items,221unique notice numbers, paused+maintenance and migrated schema, then uses the ordinary redacting/hashing archive function. **221inserted,0skipped** in production; no SEAP traffic.

Under host `/srv/seap/src/.git/deploy.lock`, replayCLIprocessed **18,388participation-list records**, boundary **18216991**, successfully. Earlier local testing caught an ordering mistake (`id::text` alias); corrected to numeric`ORDER BY r.id` before deployment. Live verification found **zero missing or mismatched raw/core identities**, and bothCN1002119andSCN1002813exist at publicID100004524.

Core counts immediately after repair:CN34,982;DC2;PC1,130;RFQ157,206 =193,320. New raw records from the following historical scan are **not** included in this completed replay. Do not claim all newly discovered notices have been normalized/published.

`recover-known-gaps.sql` captured old76task states/parameters/errors and retry budgets in `app.collection_audit`, retained every HTTPattempt, reset exactly those tasks for a fresh manual attempt, and added21April2022award page0. Control102→103, resumed collection, rates unchanged.

## Targeted recovery: final observed outcome

- **70of the original76detail tasks complete;6failed** at23:21RO.
- Missing21April2022: **115award notices archived**, both list pages reconcile to115. **All115contract inventories complete**, containing **1,382contract-notice memberships**. These are not necessarily1,382distinct economic contracts after cross-publication deduplication.
- That day's forms: **113of115graphs complete**; one failed root and one pending root remain.
- Four explicitSEAP400`EnlistTransaction` errors received **one further manual attempt after five minutes**, using audited one-time `retry-confirmed-source-transactions.sql`. Two succeeded; tasks100727and535971still return the source DBtransaction error. Do not rerun that one-time operation.

Outstanding detail tasks:

| Task | Notice / public ID | Latest task state |
|---:|---|---|
|38572|CAN1086297 /100656791|failed, transport/timeout path|
|92221|CAN1058738 /100612900|failed, transport/timeout path|
|100727|SCNA1132395 /100623963|failed,HTTP400EnlistTransaction|
|105969|CAN1112296 /100578522|failed, transport/timeout path|
|179364|CAN1141226 /100637793|failed, transport/timeout path|
|186844|CAN1128640 /100637102|failed, transport/timeout path|
|535971|SCNA1068545 /100284459|failed,HTTP400EnlistTransaction,new2022day|
|535811|new2022day detail|pending, retry due20:00:33.928352UTC but global block prevents admission|

At23:21RO,retry rows for92221,105969,179364,186844and535811still show`pending`,timeouts2. Five original CAN roots failed after timeouts on multiple different proxy IDs; the generic message “proxy failed” does **not** prove the proxy is the root cause. Source endpoint slowness remains possible. No request deadline increase or blanketHTTP400retry policy was implemented. The gate retains45seconds and bounded5/10minute retry behavior.

See [known-gap snapshot](checkpoints/20261009-notice-identity/known-gap-status.txt). Its pipe-separated format is the output of the named read-only SQL report; source graph counts differ deliberately from individual task counts.

## Historical inventory mode and progress

Commit **b95cc8a**, deployed successfully:

- `Task.params.inventoryOnly=true`, valid only for tender/award list tasks; separate `:inventory`partition/key prevents confusing it with full recovery.
- Same source client, shared gate, limits, pauses, quiet window, transactional archival/checkpoint and durable pagination. Existing worker restarts resume it; no terminal-dependent crawler.
- Validated list pages retain their source records. **No automatic forms/lots/contract/PDF fanout** in this mode. Ordinary new-day recovery still expands full graphs.
- `apps/ingestion/src/collection/inventory.ts` compares namespaced public IDs plus notice numbers and known internal IDs against current core. Result records `checked`, `matched`, `missing`, `unverified`. Null legacy notice numbers are unverified, not matches. Contradictions stop before archival/normalization.
- These are **at-collection snapshots**. Later normalization may restore identities but does not rewrite the original missing-at-collection evidence.
- Admin forecasting estimates inventory pages without inventing full detail work. `/admin` currently reports this within the existing recovery batch, not a dedicated per-year historical audit UI. Use SQL report for exact per-year audit results.
- Seeded5,844daily partitions:2families×2,922days for2018–2025, newest first,priority20below ordinary current recovery. Continuation pages are dynamically added. Do not divide completed pages by5,844and call it a reliable final percent.
- Pilot16daily partitions/eight years completed24pages, no conflicts,34additional participation gaps archived. Then seeded all days with idempotent keys; all source limits remained unchanged.

Final scan snapshot before the pagination block:

| Period | Award days reconciled | Participation days reconciled |
|---|---:|---:|
|2025|365/365|365/365|
|2024|38/366|106/366|
|2018–2023|1pilotday/year/family|1pilotday/year/family|

2025:36,669award records matched core;26,698participation source records =15,451matching+**11,247missing at collection**. 2024partial:3,399participation gaps. Together with olderpilotdays, **14,678distinct missing scoped participation identities**, **all14,678sharing their numeric public ID with another namespace already stored**. This remains a partial historical count, not a final all-years loss estimate. Missing participation metadata does not prove corresponding awarded contracts/money were absent.

Full [inventory snapshot](checkpoints/20261009-notice-identity/inventory-status.txt):680award pages complete+675tender pages complete;1awardpagefailed;2,512awardpagespending+2,445tenderpagespending. Successful days/records can lag known source totals on an unfinished partition. Do not use raw “known source totals” over pending days as a full denominator.

## Separate publication blocker: still unresolved

[8October recovery report](../implementation/recovery-20261008/README.md) is the starting point. Normalization fixes for three bad contract envelopes were deployed earlier. The9October05:00fullrun progressed pastnormalize but stopped at **identity-quality**.

The approved cross-publication dedup registry expected pairs; new source rows introduce a third publication:

-8,854of16,090approved member fingerprints stale at the earlier preflight.
-Third-publication cohort6,856rows.
-ExampleCAN1086297, same600lei contract dated3June2024:107775175(notice100638155),108112409(100656791),new108167589(100659131).
-Checksum-pinned verification stopped with`Publication multiplicity changed:107775175`.

**Do not reset fingerprints, disable this guard, or reopen the site because collection/notice repair succeeded.** This session did not modify the dedup registry, run new marts/risk/search rebuilds or publish a ready snapshot. Existing public maintenance remains. Scheduled daily stats/normalization and Sunday risk are still configured; a failed publication can require a one-off full retry. Recheck the overnight run tomorrow.

## Earlier throughput repair in this same workstream

The drop from~130–140to~80requests/min was a local serialized DBquery, not demonstrated SEAPslowness. `app.collection_requests` had grown enough that active-request ownership checks scanned~368krows while holding control.

- Partial index`app.collection_requests_running(id) WHERE outcome='running'`, concurrently prebuilt onproduction; schema/migration0063preserve it normally.
- Query421.175ms→0.420ms;690requests/five minutes≈138/min,zero failures at verification.
- Commit06d5408,deployedActions37932378118;docs809a506.
- No source rate/concurrency change. Preserve this index and the request ownership checks.
- [Full report](../implementation/collection-throughput-20261009.md).

## Local/server artifacts and commands

Working directory:`/Users/alexcosma/Desktop/Personal/code/seap`. Node22binary directory:`/Users/alexcosma/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin`;pnpm9.4.0. SSH:`seap@62.83.11.204`. Serverrepo:`/srv/seap/src`;compose:`infra/prod`. DBcontainer:`cinecastiga-postgres-1`,DB/user:`seap`. Collector:`cinecastiga-collection-1`.

No secrets required in the checkpoint; use existing local/server environment. `gh` is unavailable; public GitHub Actions API can report run status without credentials.

Safe read-only reports:

```sh
ssh seap@62.83.11.204 'docker exec -i cinecastiga-postgres-1 psql -U seap -d seap -X -Atq -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1' < scripts/operations/20261009-notice-identity/known-gap-status.sql
ssh seap@62.83.11.204 'docker exec -i cinecastiga-postgres-1 psql -U seap -d seap -X -Atq -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1' < scripts/operations/20261009-notice-identity/inventory-status.sql
```

Reports have bounded statement timeouts. Avoid dumping unbounded legacy`core.scrape_runs.error`or credentials/session/request headers; some old errors contain huge SQLpayloads. Inspect selected fields or truncate messages.

Local ignored artifacts:

-`.local/coverage-audit-20261009/`: sourcefirstpages,followupprobes,requestledger,comparisons,displacedrecords.
-`.local/history-coverage-20261008/`: two115-awarddaypages.
-`.local/notice-identity-20261009/`: schema/historydumps,productionidentityCSV,known221bundle,replaytestlog,verificationSQL,olderrunningstatusJSON.
-`.local/notice-identity-20261009/checkpoint/`: currentblockedresponseandderivedpublicsummary. Older`latest-inventory-status.json`at19:56UTCshowsrunningstate and is **superseded**.

Isolated local databases remain:`seap_test_notice_identity_20261009`and`seap_test_notice_rehearsal_20261009`. The ordinary local database was **not** migrated/refreshed by this repair. RehearsalDBcontains an identity projection,notfullproduction. Schema imports needed removal of unsupported`SET transaction_timeout=0`emitted by newerlocalpg_dump; no real database was reset. No active local source crawler or observer is required for resumption.

Example targeted checks (set`TEST_DATABASE_URL`yourself to the isolatedDB; never ordinarylocal/prod):

```sh
export PATH=/Users/alexcosma/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin:$PATH
pnpm --filter ingestion typecheck
pnpm --filter ingestion test
pnpm --filter ingestion exec vitest run src/normalize/notice-identity.integration.test.ts src/collection/inventory.integration.test.ts src/collection/runner.integration.test.ts
pnpm --filter web exec vitest run lib/admin/recovery-status.integration.test.ts
```

RunDBsuites sequentially where fixtures share tables. Integrationtests truncate fixturetables; verify the isolated URL before execution.

## Suggested prompt for the next session

> Read AGENTS.md and docs/handover/continuation-20261009-notice-identity.md first. Yesterday's notice identity fix and historical scan are deployed on production, but collection stopped on task542533: award inventory2024-11-28 has180advertised rows and179distinct IDs across two pages. Do not just restart or relax counts. Inspect saved evidence and current overnight state; then implement/test a correct pagination recovery, preserve the old evidence, resume safely, and continue the historical inventory. Keep the existing proxy settings and maintenance. The separate contract-publication/deduplication guard remains unresolved and must not be bypassed. Preserve unrelated dirty files. No subagent delegation unless newly authorized.

Owner-facing status pages: [Colectare](https://cinecastiga.ro/admin), [Jurnal](https://cinecastiga.ro/admin/jurnal), [Procesare](https://cinecastiga.ro/admin/procesare). A successful HTTP200inJurnal can still have failed task validation; the source block and task diagnostics explain this incident.
