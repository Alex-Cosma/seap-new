/**
 * Firm attributes from the ONRC register for Ask's filters (plan F5,
 * 24 October 2026), on the supplier profiles of marts.entity_profile
 * (migration 0086). Built by the marts stage from data already imported.
 *
 * - `registered_year`: the oldest year among the ONRC registration numbers of
 *   the CUI ("Înmatriculate din {an}"). Both formats carry the year: the old
 *   `J12/345/2004` (office, sequence, year) and the new `J2024000123408`
 *   (year, sequence, three check digits), with the prefix J (company), F
 *   (PFA, II, IF) or C (cooperative). A seat move registers the firm again in
 *   the new county under that year, so the oldest year is the registration
 *   and the newest one the current seat (5,959 suppliers on the local copy).
 * - `seat_county` / `seat_source` (rule in packages/db/src/firm-seat.ts): the
 *   ONRC seat is the county of the latest registration: the newest year, then
 *   a new-format number before an old one (the new format replaced the old
 *   one, so it was issued later; the snapshot has no old number after 2024),
 *   then the highest sequence, then the number as text, so the choice never
 *   depends on row order. Sequences are counted by each county office (new
 *   numbers too, before 2025), so when the newest year has only old numbers,
 *   from several counties, they do not say which is later: the SEAP county is
 *   taken if it is one of them, else the ONRC seat is undecided (133 suppliers
 *   on the local copy of 24 October 2026; 58 left undecided).
 *   Counties are written in the spelling of `core.entities.county`, which the
 *   transaction rows carry as buyer county. When the ONRC seat is undecided,
 *   or its registration names no county, the SEAP county applies.
 *
 * Only a corroborated CUI is joined to ONRC (cuiCorroborated, audit F03). A
 * foreign seat has no registered_year: a foreign firm is not "registered in
 * {year}", whatever an ONRC namesake's number says. A year before 1990 (the
 * register's start) or after the snapshot is not read. Authority rows keep
 * the three columns null; an authority's county is `county`.
